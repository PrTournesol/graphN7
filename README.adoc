== Getting start

* Java 
** verify you have the jdk 1.8 installed, in a terminal : 
    
    javac -version
    
*** you shoud have

    javac 1.8.xxx
    
*** if not, dowload and install from http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/pt/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html[here] 

* Git :
** in a terminal :

    Git
    
*** you should have : 
    
    $ git
    usage: git [--version] [--help] [-C <path>] [-c name=value]
           [--exec-path[=<path>]] [--html-path] [--man-path] [--info-path]
           [-p | --paginate | --no-pager] [--no-replace-objects] [--bare]
           [--git-dir=<path>] [--work-tree=<path>] [--namespace=<name>]
           <command> [<args>]
           

*** if not, dowload Git from https://git-scm.com/download[here]  and install
** clone the repository, and go in :

    git clone https://github.com/PrTournesol/graphN7.git
    cd graphN7

* Graphviz :
** on Windows : nothing is necessary
** on Linux or Max :
    
    chmod u+x lib/graphviz/linux_bin/dot
    
*** this is the binary of Graphviz, if you don't trust mine, you'll find the offitial on https://www.graphviz.org/download/[this] page, you could also make this if you have a package manager like apt :
    
    apt-get install graphviz
    
*** After installing the package on your system, please copy the dot binary on this path lib/graphviz/linux_bin/dot

    cp <your dot binary path> lib/graphviz/linux_bin/dot
    
*** repeat the chmod command if dot hasn't execute right

* Ant :
** verify you have ant installed, in a terminal : 
    
    ant
    
*** you shoud have

    Buildfile: build.xml does not exist!
    Build failed

*** if not, dowload and install from http://ant.apache.org/[here]

== Compile the project
** On project folder, in a terminal : 

    ant build

== Launch the main
** On project folder, in a terminal : 

    ant main  
    
** you will see the main menu appears, you have the choice to generate a complete, cycle or random graph. The second type of random is vertices with maximum 1 of weight

** generated graphs are under graphs folder

== Launch a simple Dijkstra
** On project folder, in a terminal : 

    ant Disjkstra  

** generated graphs are under graphs folder

== Launch a simple BFS
** On project folder, in a terminal : 

    ant BFS  

** generated graphs are under graphs folder
